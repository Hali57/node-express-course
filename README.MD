My Contribution -I added the url-shortener file . It has code that is essential for shortening urls. I found it usefull in completing a project that was part of the back-end development course provided by Freecodecamp.
---i then added an index.js file in the url shortener that contains alternative code that uses asychronous functions to shorten a url alongside express.js. This created a conflict that i resolved. using
'git pull origin main' command
--- I then created an index.html file and hosted it on gitHub for the first time, which was fun. This was done by enabling gitHub pages located in settings.
--- i also joined codeTriage a site dedicated to providing open source repos and thus the chance to contribute and work with other developers.
